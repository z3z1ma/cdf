# cdf

cdf (Continuous Data Flow) is a simple data framework built in Python. Internally we leverage dlt and sqlmesh in order
to provide a simple interface for data scientists and engineers to build data pipelines. The target audience of cdf
are data platform engineers who are looking to put together a unified data platform for their organization utilizing
best-in-class open source tools. We take the best in both data ingestion and data transformation and marry them together
in conjunction with a simple interface and opinionated design.
