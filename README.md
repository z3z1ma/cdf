## üìç Overview

CDF (Continuous Data Framework) is an integrated framework designed to manage data across the entire lifecycle, from ingestion through transformation to publishing. It is built on top of two open-source projects, `sqlmesh` and `dlt`, providing a unified interface for complex data operations. CDF simplifies data engineering workflows, offering scalable solutions from small to large projects through an opinionated project structure that supports both multi-workspace and single-workspace layouts.

> [!WARNING]
> The repo is currently under ACTIVE development with multiple large refactors already having been completed. As such, you must be aware that the codebase is not yet stable and is subject to change. Furthermore, you must look to the code (or tests) itself for the most accurate and up-to-date information until this disclaimer is removed.
