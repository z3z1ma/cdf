# cdf

CDF (Continuous Data Framework) is an integrated framework
designed to manage data across the entire lifecycle, from
ingestion through transformation to publishing. It is built on top
of two open-source projects, `sqlmesh` and `dlt`, providing a
unified interface for complex data operations. CDF simplifies data
engineering workflows, offering scalable solutions from small to
large projects through an opinionated project structure that
supports both multi-workspace and single-workspace layouts.
