"""CDF - Continuous Data Framework

CDF is a framework for managing data end to end. It can be though of as a wrapper on top of
2 best-in-class open source projects: sqlmesh and dlt. It provides a way to manage data
from ingestion to transformation to publishing. It gives you a unified pane of glass with
an opnionated project structure supporting both multi-workspace and single-workspace
layouts allowing it to scale from small to large projects. It provides opinionated features
that augment dlt and sqlmesh including automated virtual environment management, automated
discoverability of pipelines and publishers, automated configuration management, and
more.
